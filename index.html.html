  <p> <em>Student | Traveller | Curious (<strong>Always!</strong>) </em> </p>
  <p>Hi there I am Aaryan Budhwar I study in Delhi Public School, Gwalior. I love to participate in competitions which are related to public speaking, debating and teamwork recently I have been learning coding with HTML and have participated in number of MUNs also not to mention I am campaigning for the house captain in our School</p>

  <h2>Who am I? </h2>
  <p>This is a question which I always have trouble answering, even at the age of 13 I can't answer this question properly. I don't mean to say I have no idea of who I am but my identity, hobbies and my preferences will keep on changing so there is no definite answer to this question. But what I do know is what I am at present, I am an inquisitive student who loves to travel visit places all over India sadly I am not much familiar with the east but after coronavirus I will be going somewhere in east to visit. I love to read books specially about problems faced by Indians. I love participating in MUNs because this competiton has everything I like. I also try to make my weakness a strong point of mine for example I was pretty good in socializing and all the teachers used to think that I am very good in public speaking as well but unfortunately I was another victim of stage freight I realised this when i was participating in inter school hindi declamation since then this problem has slowly and slowly gone and my public speaking skills have improved. </p>
